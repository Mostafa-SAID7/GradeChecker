# Grade Checker Console App

## 📋 Description
This is a simple **C# console application** that prompts the user to enter their exam marks and outputs the corresponding **letter grade**. It uses `Convert.ToInt32()` to convert the input and a `try-catch` block to handle invalid input gracefully.

## 🎯 Features

  - **A** for 90 and above  
  - **B** for 80–89  
  - **C** for 70–79  
  - **D** for 60–69  
  - **F** for below 60
- Handles non-numeric input using error handling.
- Clean and beginner-friendly logic using `if-else` statements.
